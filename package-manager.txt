I tried everything for this part but things were not wroking out. First I tried all of this:

[root@docable /] #  npm install curl
bash: npm: command not found
[root@docable /] #  pip install curl
bash: pip: command not found
[root@docable /] #  apt-get install <curl>   
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
[root@docable /] #  apt-get install curl

[root@docable /] #  apt-get install npm forever

Then I tried to install chocoloatey, but the link doesnt work and the info I found online was not working either.
I've used package managers before but I'm not sure why they are not working in this environment
